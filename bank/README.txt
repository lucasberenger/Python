## How to use the Bank? 

1. Open bank.py in your terminal (or cmd, or bash, or whatever the kind of terminal you like); 
2. Run 'python bank.py';
3. Choose between the options: you can check the balance (1), deposit (2) and withdraw (3). The fourth (4) option closes the app; 
4. Everytime you choose to deposit or withdraw, once the operation has been completed, the aplication will generate a receipt.
