# Simple Banking Aplication

This is the final project for the Python module in the course "The Ultimate 2023 Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp."
I highly recommend this course if you want to learn how to code. Check it out: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-fullstack-web-development-bootcamp/

## How to use the Bank?

You only will need a text editor to run The Banking Aplication.

1. Open bank.py in your terminal (or cmd, or bash, or whatever the kind of terminal you like);
2. Run 'python bank.py' (Make sure you are in the correct directory);
3. Choose between the options: you can check the balance (1), deposit (2) and withdraw (3). The fourth (4) option closes the app;
4. Everytime you choose to deposit or withdraw, once the operation has been completed, the aplication will generate a receipt.
